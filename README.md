# StimIQ - DBS Optimization and Simulation for Parkinson's Disease

StimIQ is a hackathon project that helps neurologists make more data-driven decisions in DBS programming. It combines a full-loop simulation system with Bayesian optimization to recommend stimulation parameters, and an LLM-based medical agent to explain model decisions.

Novelty: we incorporate data collected before routine checkups (wearables + patient QoL) to improve DBS treatment outcomes, reduce reliance on scarce specialists, and enable more equal care.

Key features:
- Clinician-facing tool for data-driven DBS programming.
- Full-loop simulation to demonstrate Bayesian optimization for parameter recommendation.
- LLM-based medical agent for interpretable, human-readable explanations.
- Pre-checkup wearable and QoL data integration for personalized treatment.
