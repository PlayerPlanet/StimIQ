abstract: >
  StimIQ is a clinician-facing decision-support system for Deep Brain Stimulation
  (DBS) programming in Parkinson's disease. The platform integrates a physics-informed
  tremor simulation pipeline, Bayesian optimisation for stimulation parameter
  recommendation, and an LLM-based medical agent that produces interpretable,
  human-readable explanations of model decisions.
